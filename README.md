Which products/regions generate the highest revenue?
Where is there negative profit?
How do sales trends change over time?
How do customer segments differ?

The analysis reveals that the West and East regions are the strongest revenue drivers, generating approximately $108K and $92K in profit, respectively. In comparison, the South and Central regions contributed significantly less, at $47K and $40K. This highlights the importance of maintaining and strengthening our position in the West and East markets.The analysis also uncovered negative profits in certain product categories. The largest loss was in the Tables sub-category, with around $18K in losses. Smaller losses were observed in Bookcases and Supplies, suggesting that pricing or cost strategies in these product lines may need to be revisited.Sales showed a steady upward trend over the years, increasing from $0.48 million in 2014 to $0.73 million in 2017. Although there was a slight dip in 2015, sales quickly rebounded in 2016 and continued to grow through 2017.Regarding customer segments, the Consumer segment was the most profitable, generating about $134K in profit. Corporate customers followed with $92K, while the Home Office segment lagged behind at $60K. This clearly indicates that the Consumer market drives the largest share of profit and should remain a key strategic focus.
