Between 2014 and 2017, our sales and profit analysis shows that the West and East regions are our strongest revenue drivers. 
The West region generated around 108K in profit, while the East brought in 92K. In comparison, the South and Central regions contributed significantly less, at 47K and 40K respectively.
 This indicates that maintaining and strengthening our position in the West and East markets should be a priority.
However, the analysis also revealed negative profits in certain product categories. The most significant loss comes from the Tables sub-category, with around 18K in losses. 
Smaller losses are also seen in Bookcases and Supplies. This suggests that these product lines may require adjustments in pricing or cost strategies.
Looking at sales trends, we can see a consistent upward trajectory from 2014 to 2017. Sales increased from 0.48 million in 2014 to 0.73 million in 2017.
 There was a slight dip in 2015, but sales quickly rebounded in 2016 and continued to grow through 2017.
In terms of customer segments, the Consumer segment is the most profitable, generating about 134K in profit. Corporate customers follow with 92K, 
while the Home Office segment lags behind at 60K. This clearly highlights that the Consumer market drives the largest share of our profit and remains a key strategic focus.
